    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>
        As Y Combinator alums (2008) and dedicated hackers, we love Hacker News. And as a database-as-a-service
        provider, we use Hacker News as an important channel for reaching developers. But other than watching a
        post's performance as it happens, there hasn't been great data to actually analyze the time-based
        performace of a post. So we figured we'd change that.
    </p>

    <p>hind-cite is a few things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A time-series database of post performance, with some views and queries to allow you to access
            the database more effectively
        </li>
        <li>A REST interface</li>
        <li>A website with a few starting charts</li>
        <li>A community of hackers adding new charts and analyses, hosted here (Hopefully!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Data</h2>

    <p>
        hind-cite uses a screen scraper to capture the first two pages of Hacker News, approximately every 5 minutes.
        We started collecting the data in January 2014. We had a few scraper problems, so the data doesn't get very
        clean until mid-February. And even then, occasionally HN will be down, or our scraper's host will be down,
        or we'll run into some other intermittent problem. The data is pretty clean, but not perfect. A good
        way to glance at our data depth is with the <a href="/snapsPerDay">Snapshots Per Day chart</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Database</h2>

    <p>
        The database is hosted here: <a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news">https://cs.cloudant.com/news</a>. Not
        surprsingly, it is hosted on on <a href="https://cloudant.com">Cloudant</a> - a database-as-a-service
        provider (and IBM&reg; company).
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Intro to Cloudant</h2>

    <p>
        Cloudant is a hosted and managed distributed database-as-a-service, based on a horizontally scalable version of
        Apache CouchDB and other tools. A Cloudant database is a schemaless JSON document store sharded across a set of
        nodes (a la Dynamo), featuring incrementally-updated MapReduce Views, secondary key indexing, built-in full text
        search (based on Lucene), geo-spatial indexing, multi-master replication (supports global data distribution) and
        communicates over an HTTP RESTful API. </p>

    <h2>Views & Queries</h2>

    <p>
        Here are a few ways to access the data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Base URI</b> - <a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news">https://cs.cloudant.com/news</a></li>
        <li>
            <b>_all_docs</b> - _all_docs is the primary index and is available in any Cloudant database. Here's an
            example:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_all_docs?limit=1&include_docs=true">https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_all_docs?limit=1&include_docs=true</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>snaps-per-day view</b> - A view is a way of viewing and aggregating the data (using map/reduce). This
            view shows the number of snapshots per day (where a "snapshot" is a view of a post at a moment in time -
            so a screen capture of the HN homepage would have 30 snapshots).
            This is also the raw data for the <a href="/snapsPerDay">SnapsPerDay chart</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_view/snaps-per-day?group=true&limit=10">https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_view/snaps-per-day?group=true&limit=10</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>latest view</b> - This shows the latest posts that we have in our database. Since we only
            screen-scrape the top two pages, at most this will return 60 records.
            This is the
            source for the <a href="multiPost?list=top&limit=all">Post History - latest chart</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_view/latest?reduce=true&group=true&group_level=1&limit=5">https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_view/latest?reduce=true&group=true&group_level=1&limit=5</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Lucene Search</b> - Cloudant's Lucene search funcationality is a very powerful way of querying the
            data, and is the source for the <a href="/multiPost?list=points&limit=all">Post History - Max Points
            chart</a> and the <a href="/multiPost?list=comments&limit=all"> Post History - Max Comments chart</a>.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_search/posts?q=points:[0 TO
                    Infinity]&sort=-points&include_docs=true&limit=10">https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_search/posts?q=points:[0

                </li>
                <li><a href="https://cs.cloudant.com/news/_design/by/_search/posts?q=comments:[0 TO

                    TO
                    Infinity]&sort=-comments&include_docs=true&limit=10</a>
                </li>
                <li>Indexed Fields
                    <ul>
                        <li>points</li>
                        <li>comments</li>

                        <li>id</li>
                        <li>title</li>
                        <li>domain</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>REST Interface</h2>

    <p>Cloudant has a very powerful and flexible interface. With the above views you can probably do most of what you'd
        want, but we're happy to add more views if needed. (Just submit an issue on the <a
                href="https://github.com/rr326/hind-cite/issues">github repo</a>.) To learn more, check out:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://cloudant.com/for-developers/">Simple Overview</a></li>
        <li><a href="API Reference">API Reference</a></li>
        <li><b>Browser Devlopment Console </b> - Open any chart with the browser's developer console open. You'll see
            the full jquery ajax call that serves the data for that page, as well as the returned JSON.
        </li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>This Website &amp; The Community</h2>

    <p>
        There are plenty of very interesting analyses this data makes available. With the REST interface and existing
        queries, you can pretty much do whatever you'd like. But to make things easier, we're happy to host charts or
        analyses based on the data. Just add a page and <a href="git@github.com:rr326/hind-cite.git">submit a pull
        request</a>.
    </p>
