        <h1>Number of snapshots per day</h1>
        <p>A 'snapshot' is an individual data point. So, as single page has 30 snapshots every time we do a screen scrape
            (which is approximately every 5 minutes). We would expect to see about 17,280 snapshots a day (2 pages * every 5
            minutes for 24 horus) if all goes well. A bar with significantly fewer data points means all did not go well -
            our script failed, our server went down, we were working on the script, or HackerNews was down.
